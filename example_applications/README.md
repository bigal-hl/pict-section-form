# Example Applications

These applications exercise the library from very basic to complex.

## The Basics

These forms are meant to provide simple configuration-based test
suites for the framework.

### Simple Form

The most basic example.  A small one file form with some basic math
and inputs.  No styling, no jquery just a very basic manifest.

### Simple Table

A simple example of a tabular form.  Loads up some data about fruit
and shows a few columns.  Single file, all configuration.

### Simple Table from Object

A simple example of a tabular form pulling rows from a plain old
javascript object as opposed to an array.  Single file, all
configuration.

### Complex Table

A more complex tabular form example that uses the fruit data again
and performs mathematical solves across each row, and aggregation
functions down.  Single file, all configuration, no code.

## Advanced

### Postcard

A silly mock startup example with a form and other views to toggle
between.  Multiple forms sections, shows an example of creating a
theme.

### Gradebook

A full fledged application built in the framework, using the tools 
as intended by design.  Multiple grids, math and data persistence
in the browser.
