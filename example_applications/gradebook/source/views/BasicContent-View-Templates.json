This is where we sprinkle a bit of humor on the otherwise dry and dusty legal stuff. Grab a cup of coffee, sit back, and enjoy our attempt to make legal jargon slightly less snooze-inducing.</p>\n\n<h2>Terms of Use</h2>\n<p>By using GradeMaster Pro, you agree to these terms. If you don’t agree, well, you probably shouldn’t be here. Seriously, we’ve put a lot of thought into this, so trust us, it’s worth agreeing to.</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Don’t Be Evil</strong>: Stealing grades, hacking into accounts, or impersonating a teacher’s pet is strictly prohibited. Play nice!</li>\n\t<li><strong>No Robots Allowed</strong>: Unless you’re a cool, teaching robot from the future, no automated systems or scripts here, folks. We like our users human.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Use Responsibly</strong>: GradeMaster Pro is here to make your life easier, not to be used as a tool to procrastinate from actual grading. Use it wisely!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>\n<p>We take your privacy very seriously. Like, top-secret, James Bond seriously. Here’s how we handle your info:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: We collect only what we need to make your experience awesome. No more, no less.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Cookies</strong>: Yes, we use cookies. Not the chocolate chip kind (sadly), but the digital kind to keep things running smoothly.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sharing Information</strong>: We don’t sell your data to third parties. We wouldn’t even know how to price it. Your secrets are safe with us.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>Let’s keep this simple: if something goes wrong (like the internet breaking, your computer spontaneously combusting, or an alien invasion), GradeMaster Pro is not liable. We’re here to help, but some things are just out of our control.</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>No Guarantees</strong>: We strive for perfection, but we’re not perfect. If things go awry, we’ll do our best to fix them. No guarantees, but plenty of effort.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Damages</strong>: In the rare event that GradeMaster Pro causes you any damages (physical, emotional, or psychological), our liability is limited to making funny jokes and sending good vibes your way.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Changes to This Agreement</h2>\n<p>We might update these terms occasionally. When we do, we promise to give you a heads-up. No sneaky stuff. Check back here from time to time, or just trust that we’ll keep things reasonable.</p>\n\n<h2>Contact Us</h2>\n<p>Still awake? Impressive! If you have any questions, comments, or jokes to share, feel free to reach out to us at <a href=\"mailto:legal@grademasterpro.com\">legal@grademasterpro.com</a>. We promise to respond faster than you can say “legal mumbo jumbo.”</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for choosing GradeMaster Pro! Remember, with great grading power comes great responsibility. Use it wisely and keep on grading like a pro!</p>\n"
